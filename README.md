# Emotion Detection

In this project, I have built a convolutional neural network using python to help predict a person's emotion by analyzing their facial features. The model works by detecting 68 facial landmarks on a given person's face and then analyzing the euclidean distances between them. I actually made three kinds of models to see which one is the most accurate: 

MLP model

CNN model

Transfer Learning model



After comparing them, I am certain that the CNN model is the most accurate of them all. 

In this project, I have used python libraries like keras and tensorflow to build and train my models, libraries like numpy and pandas to prepare and process my data, and other libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the results.
